                <h2>About The Artist</h2>
                <h2>Artist's Statement</h2>
                <p>Much of my music compositional interests lie in audience participation and the incorporation of technology to create new multi-media works with an emphasis on sound.  I am interested in creating conditions for musicians which call for the direct engagement of the audience.  For example, I wrote a piece for violin and blind audience where I passed out blindfolds to spectators as they walked into the space. I like the idea of experiencing live music without ever seeing the performer and the tension that creates. I want to challenge performer and audience roles and explore their shared energy.  I strive to fuse direct experience and art to create conditions in which to reach higher states of consciousness and understanding for me and an audience.</p>  

                <p>Experimentation with field recordings and musique concrète bled into an interest in the spontaneity of film street photography and video.  And if anything, I believe artistic gesture as a defining purpose in creation; whether it’s musical or photographic gesture, and that it’s important to see how disciplines across the arts are more related than not.  My ideas about sound, music, and photography fuel each other.</p>  

                <p>I am ultimately interested in art as a conduit to a finer self and greater love.</p>  

                <p>I was awarded The Fulton County Arts and Culture Fellowship to participate in an artist residency at the Hambidge Center for Creative Arts and Sciences in fall 2018.  I am currently an artist-in-resident at the Community Music Center in Atlanta, GA and work as a giant screen projectionist at the Fernbank Museum of Natural History.</p>
